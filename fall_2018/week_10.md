## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started working with Alex on the tutorial script for OpenCircuits.

## This Week's Plan

> Keep working on the the tutorial and try to get it to work on my own

## Anything Blocking?

> When I tried running the code on my own, nothing actually happened with the site except showing that the code

> was running in the console.

## Notes

> I'm starting to think that I should take notes on everything that Alex, Rylan, and Leon say about what they're doing.
