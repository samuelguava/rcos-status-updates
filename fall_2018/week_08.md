## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished the preview Udemy tutorials for javascript (I didn't want to pay for the whole course) and went

> through all the practice problems I could.


## This Week's Plan

> Try to find more online tutorials, and try once more to look over the OpenCircuits code.


## Anything Blocking?

> I'm still not too clear about how I'm supposed to work on the OpenCircuits code and use git to make changes.

> The (free) tutorials I'm finding don't go extremely deeply into javascript
