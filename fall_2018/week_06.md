## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I downloaded an editor (Brackets) and started going through the preview javascript tutorials on Udemy.


## This Week's Plan

> I found a table of logic gates that I will study to learn the functions of each of the components on OpenCircuits.

> I will also continue going through the javascript tutorials on Udemy, and seeing what I can do about the driver.js

> code that Alex sent me.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm still not too clear about how I'm supposed to work on the OpenCircuits code and use git to make changes.
