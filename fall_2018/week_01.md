## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on familiarizing myself more with OpenCircuits.io and figuring out the functions of each component.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to start learning how to use javascript. My goal is to spend about 30 minutes a day going over tutorials
> and the like to get myself used to using javascript.


## Anything Blocking?

> I've never used javascript, and only have a very basic understanding of code in general and limited coding experience
