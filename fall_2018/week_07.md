## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've been going over tutorials on Udemy (their coding challenges are especially helpful) and going over how the

> logic gates and components on OpenCircuits work.


## This Week's Plan

> I plan to start grinding through the Udemy tutorials more often, and continue to learn about the electrical components.


## Anything Blocking?

> I'm still not too clear about how I'm supposed to work on the OpenCircuits code and use git to make changes.

> Also, I have two tests this week that I really need to study for, so I don't know how much work I'll be able to do.
