## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have not worked on much due to homework and studying for midterms.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on solidifying my knowledge of javascript and building upon that, in addition to learning the functions

> of OpenCircuits (as well as basic circuitry compenents).

## Anything Blocking?

> In addition to my limited knowledge of javascript, I also realized that I don't know how most of the tools

> utilized on for the OpenCircuits project are actually supposed to work.

## Notes

> Start looking at other javascript tutorials, like udemy
