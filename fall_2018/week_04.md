## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have not worked on much due to homework and studying for midterms.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on maybe finding some more javascript tutorials that go more in depth, as well as finding my way

> through the OpenCircuits code and once again trying to understand each part of the code that I look through.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm still very new to coding, and I don't fully see how what I've learned in the learn-js tutorials connects to

> what we're doing in the OpenCircuits code.

## Notes

> Start looking at other javascript tutorials, like udemy
